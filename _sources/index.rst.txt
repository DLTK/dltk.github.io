==================

DLTK is a neural networks toolkit written in python, on top of `Tensorflow <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_. Its modular architecture is closely inspired by `sonnet <https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet>`_ and it was developed to enable fast prototyping and ensure reproducibility in image analysis applications, with a particular focus on medical imaging. Its goal is to provide the community with state of the art methods and models and to accelerate research in this exciting field.
